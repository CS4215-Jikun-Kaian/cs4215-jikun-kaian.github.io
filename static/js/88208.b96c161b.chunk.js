Building Abstractions with Functions\n1. **Introduction to Programming Concepts:**- Discusses John Locke's ideas on mental processes, emphasizing abstraction as a key concept in forming general ideas- Introduces the concept of computational processes, likening them to abstract beings that manipulate data according to program rules.\n2. **Programming Language Selection:** - Chooses JavaScript as the programming language for expressing procedural thoughts. - Traces the development of JavaScript from its origins in controlling web browsers to its current status as a general-purpose programming language.\n3. **JavaScript Characteristics and Standardization:** - Highlights JavaScript's core features inherited from Scheme and Self languages.- Notes the standardization efforts, leading to ECMAScript, and its evolution, with ECMAScript 2015 as a significant edition.- Discusses JavaScript's initial interpretation in web browsers and its subsequent efficient execution using techniques like JIT compilation.\n4. **Practical Application of JavaScript:**- Emphasizes the practicality of embedding JavaScript in web pages and its role in web browser interactions.- Recognizes JavaScript's expanding role as a general-purpose programming language, especially with the advent of systems like Node.js.- Points out JavaScript's suitability for an online version of a book on computer programs due to its execution capabilities in web browsers.",1.1:"1.1: The Elements of Programming\n1. **Programming Language Components:**- A powerful programming language involves more than instructing a computer; it's a framework for organizing ideas about processes.- Focuses on three mechanisms: primitive expressions, means of combination, and means of abstraction.\n2. **Elements in Programming:**- Programming deals with two key elements: functions and data.- Defines data as manipulable 'stuff' and functions as rules for manipulating data.- Emphasizes the importance of a language describing primitive data and functions and combining/abstracting them.\n3. **Chapter Scope:**- Chapter focuses on simple numerical data to explore rules for building functions.- Acknowledges the complexity of handling numbers in programming languages, deferring detailed exploration to later chapters.\n4. **Numerical Considerations:**- Raises issues in dealing with numbers, such as distinctions between integers and real numbers.- Acknowledges challenges like arithmetic operations, representation limits, and roundoff behavior.- Declares the book's focus on large-scale program design, deferring detailed numerical analysis.","1.1.1":"1.1.1  Expressions\n1. **JavaScript Interpreter Interaction:**- Introduction to programming via interactions with a JavaScript interpreter.- Statements involve typing expressions, and the interpreter responds by displaying the evaluated results.\n2. **Expression Statements:**- Expression statements consist of an expression followed by a semicolon.- Primitive expressions include numbers; evaluation involves clicking, displaying the interpreter, and running the statement.\n3. **Compound Expressions:**- Expressions combining numbers with operators form compound expressions.- Examples of operator combinations with arithmetic operators and infix notation are provided.\n4. **Read-Evaluate-Print Loop:**- JavaScript interpreter operates in a read-evaluate-print loop.- Complex expressions are handled, and the interpreter reads, evaluates, and prints results in a cycle.","1.1.2":"1.1.2  Naming and the Environment\n1. **Constants and Declarations:**- JavaScript uses constant declarations (e.g., const size = 2;) to associate names with values (constants).- Names like size can then be used in expressions, providing a means of abstraction for simple values.\n2. **Abstraction with Constants:**- Constant declaration is a simple form of abstraction, allowing the use of names for results of compound operations.- Examples include using constants like pi and radius in calculations for circumference.\n3. **Incremental Program Development:**- JavaScript's incremental development involves step-by-step construction of computational objects using name-object associations.- The interpreter supports this process by allowing incremental creation of associations in successive interactions.\n4. **Program Environment:**- The interpreter maintains a memory called the program environment, tracking name-object pairs.- This environment is crucial for understanding interpreter operation and implementing interpreters in later chapters.","1.1.3":"1.1.3: Evaluating Operator Combinations\n1. **Evaluation of Operator Combinations:**- The interpreter follows a procedure to evaluate operator combinations.- Recursive evaluation involves assessing operand expressions and applying the operator's function.- Recursive nature simplifies the understanding of complex, nested combinations in a hierarchical, tree-like structure.\n2. **Recursion in Evaluation:**- Recursion efficiently handles deeply nested combinations.- A tree representation illustrates the percolation of operand values upward during evaluation.- General process type known as 'tree accumulation.'\n3. **Handling Primitive Expressions:**- Primitive cases involve evaluating numerals and names.- Numerals represent the numbers they name.- Names derive values from the environment where associations are stored.\n4. **Role of Environment in Evaluation:**- The environment is crucial for determining name meanings in expressions.- In JavaScript, a name's value depends on the environment, especially in interactive contexts.- Declarations, like `const x = 3;`, associate names with values and aren't handled by the evaluation rule.","1.1.4":"1.1.4 Compound Functions\n1. **Compound Functions in JavaScript:**- Function declarations offer a powerful abstraction, allowing compound operations to be named.- Declaring a function involves specifying parameters, a return expression, and associating it with a name.- Function applications, like `square(21)`, execute the named function with specified arguments, yielding a result.\n2. **Function Application in JavaScript:**- To evaluate a function application, subexpressions (function and arguments) are evaluated, and the function is applied to the arguments.- Nested function applications, such as `square(square(3))`, demonstrate the versatility of this approach.\n3. **Building Functions with Compound Functions:**- Functions like `sum_of_squares` can be defined using previously declared functions (e.g., `square`) as building blocks.- Primitive functions provided by the JavaScript environment, like `math_log`, are used similarly to compound functions.\n4. **Syntax and Naming Conventions:**- Function declaration syntax involves naming, specifying parameters, and defining the return expression.- Common JavaScript conventions, like camel case or snake case, affect the readability of multi-part function names (e.g., `sum_of_squares`).","1.1.5":"1.1.5 The Substitution Model for Function Application\n1. **Substitution Model for Function Application:**- The interpreter follows a substitution model when evaluating function applications in JavaScript.- For compound functions, it involves replacing parameters with corresponding arguments in the return expression.- This model helps conceptualize function application but differs from the actual interpreter's workings.\n2. **Applicative-Order vs. Normal-Order Evaluation:**- Applicative-order evaluation, used by JavaScript, evaluates arguments before function application.- Normal-order evaluation substitutes arguments for parameters until only operators and primitive functions remain, then evaluates.- Both methods yield the same result for functions modeled using substitution, but normal order is more complex.\n3. **Implications of Evaluation Models:**- The substitution model serves as a starting point for thinking formally about evaluation.- Over the book, more refined models will replace the substitution model, especially when dealing with 'mutable data.'- JavaScript uses applicative-order evaluation for efficiency, while normal-order evaluation has its own implications explored later.\n4. **Challenges in Substitution Process:**- The substitution process, despite its simplicity, poses challenges in giving a rigorous mathematical definition.- Issues arise from potential confusion between parameter names and identical names in expressions to which a function is applied.- Future chapters will explore variations, including normal-order evaluation and its use in handling infinite data structures.","1.1.6":"1.1.6 Conditional Expressions and Predicates\n1. **Conditional Expressions and Predicates:**- JavaScript's conditional expressions involve a predicate, a consequent expression, and an alternative expression.- The interpreter evaluates the predicate; if true, it returns the consequent expression, else the alternative expression.- Predicates include boolean operators (&&, ||) and logical negation (!), aiding in conditional logic.\n2. **Handling Multiple Cases:**- Nested conditional expressions handle multiple cases, enabling complex case analyses.- The structure uses clauses with predicates and consequent expressions, ending with a final alternative expression.- Logical composition operations like && and || assist in constructing compound predicates.\n3. **Examples and Applications:**- Functions, like absolute value (abs), can be defined using conditional expressions.- Logical operations (&&, ||, !) and comparison operators enhance the expressiveness of conditional expressions.- Exercises demonstrate practical applications, such as evaluating sequences of statements and translating expressions into JavaScript.\n4. **Evaluation Models:**- Applicative-order evaluation (JavaScript's approach) evaluates arguments before function application.- Normal-order evaluation fully expands and then reduces expressions, leading to potential multiple evaluations.- Substitution models are foundational for understanding function application but become inadequate in detailed analyses.","1.1.7":"1.1.7 Example: Square Roots by Newton's Method\n1. **Newton's Method for Square Roots:**- Mathematical and computer functions differ;

significance of local names and the independence of function meaning from parameter names are emphasized.\n3. **Lexical Scoping:**- Lexical scoping allows functions to have internal declarations, localizing subfunctions.- Block structure and lexical scoping enhance the organization of large programs.- Free names in internal declarations derive their values from the enclosing function's
